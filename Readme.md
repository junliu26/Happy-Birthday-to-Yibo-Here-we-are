# Happy Birthday to Yibo Wang on August 5th 2020! 
Yibo's birthday is around the corner. I want to light up the world map for him to celebrite his 23th birthday.Yibo said he doesn't want to celebrite birthday anymore,that's hurt our feeling. You are so young and you are supposed to be happy every birhtday in your life in future. This is my motivation of create this project to let you know how many people love you in the world!

## Overview
According to wikipeida, there are more than 35 times of wildfires that burned more than 1,000 acres (400 ha), or produced significant structural damage or casualties in California in 2019.

Smoke of wildfire not only cause death directly as linked, but also increase the hopitalization and has long term impact on people health.

Among all the particle pollution produced by wildfire, PM 2.5 is the most important and harmful to human health, that is the reason I pick it as parameter in this project.

By tracking the time ships spend in ports and scaling by their size, Smoke Stack provides an estimate of ship emissions and the basis for tailored models to match with ship protocols and port regulations. Coupled with local air quality sensor data, Smoke Stack is a powerful platform for tracking emissions, evaluating mitigation efforts, and quantifying results.

## Engineering Details
The project was implemented in stages that reflect the directory structure of this repository: [ingestion](/ingestion), [data processing](/data-processing), [database build](/database-scripts), and [data exposure/front-end](/app). See README.md in those directories for more details. Also see [presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q7Qm1ukmDi7Bal3UjiNw1xl4ZdLYwZme4oiog2zXNJY/edit#slide=id.p).

Spark did the distributed processing needed to extract the data from its home server (marinecadastre.gov), store it in an S3 data lake, and apply geo-hashing and processing steps. Intermediate data structures were stored in S3 as parquet files awaiting appends from the roughly five years of earlier data that is accessible only in ESRI geodatabase (.gdb) format. Looping back to retrieve that data and parse it is on the to-do list.

The processed data were stored in a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS EC2 and pre-processed tables for the app were built using SQL queries.

Flask, a python microserver framework, was used to build the API and GUI to expose the data to end users.
